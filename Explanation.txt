In this file I will explain my thought process on designing this project.

As for why playwright, I decided to use this challenge to try something new I've seen trending in the Test automation world.
And wanted to see how easy it would be to pick up and get a feel for it. 

I want to keep make the code i write as reusable as possible therefore I decided to go with the page object model design pattern
this allows me to reuse the code in several test without having to write it again.
Also I made all the test indepedant from eachother to make sure we can use the paralization of playwright to its full potential.
And another thing I would like to do is to make most variables based on a config/resource file or helper and then load it from there.
But unfortunately I didn;t manage to implement this under the current time constraints.

As for what I'd like to do more, is to have a bigger focus on api/graphql testing. Id rather focus more on the integration level
and minimize the front end testing to the critical paths only. 

As for the hours I have worked I have spend 6 hours on this in rough estimates.
